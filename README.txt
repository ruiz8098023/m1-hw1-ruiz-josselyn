ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
Was new to .gitignore, unsure if I needed to add an equivalent item to .DS_store
Was new to merge - almost deleted the content-test branch, but was able to navigate to each branch
The word document is where the screenshot is housed - duplicate document file found in the repository?
